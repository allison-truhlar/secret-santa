# Secret Santa

## Road Map:

### Stage One
- [ ] Create a family/group (POST)
- [ ] To that group, add all members (POST)
- [ ] Randomly assign all members to another group member who is not themselves

### Stage Two
- [ ] Create a “returning users” option, where you can type in your group name to access all the group members you input last year (READ) and use these names for the random assignments this year

###  Stage Three- achieves the Chingu Tier 3 MVP
- [ ] Be able to edit and delete members from your previous entries (UPDATE and DELETE)

### Stage Four
- [ ] For each group member, provide a unique and non-obvious URL to a route where they can view their assigned person

### Stage Five - achieves my personal MVP
- [ ] Be able to indicate exclusions (i.e. for one person, who should NOT be assigned to that person)
- [ ] Be able to assign a specific person to someone
